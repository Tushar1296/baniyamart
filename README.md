# 🛒 BaniyaMart – Online Grocery Store Web App

**BaniyaMart** is a full-stack grocery store website made for small-town stores to go online.  
Built during my freelance journey, this project helps local businesses offer online ordering — an alternative to Blinkit or Instamart in areas where such services don’t exist.
